<div style="text-align: left;">For the estimation tasks, we will provide you with a <b>histogram</b> showing the distribution of individual performances on the encoding task. To help you interpret these graphs correctly, we first introduce a simple <b>unrelated</b> example.</b>.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br><b>How to Read a Histogram</b></div>

<div style="text-align: left;">A histogram shows how data is distributed. Each bar represents a range of values, and the height of the bar tells you how many observations fall within that range.
    In the histogram shown here, we display the distribution of tree diameters in a large sample from the UK. The horizontal axis represents diameter sizes, grouped into four ranges (or "bins"), while the vertical axis shows how many trees fall into each range.
    <ul>
        <li>A taller bar means more trees have diameters in that range.</li>
        <li>A shorter bar means fewer trees have diameters in that range.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">Histograms make it easy to see which values are most common or least common. They help us recognize patterns, such as whether most trees are thin, thick, or somewhere in between.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">For example, the histogram here shows that the most common tree diameters fall between 0 and 10 cm, meaning that most trees in this sample are thin.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Similarly, the histograms will help you in the estimation tasks to see how individual performances on the encoding task are distributed.</div>
