<div>Welcome to this economic experiment. The effort you provide here can result in a considerable monetary gain. It is crucial that you read these instructions attentively. It's important to note that, in contrast to some other social sciences, economic experiments adhere to a strict non-deception policy, ensuring that all information provided to you is accurate.</div>
<br>
<div>This economic experiment is divided into three parts: a <u>Practice Part</u>, where no money can be earned, a <u>Task Part</u>, where you can earn money, and a short <u>Questionnaire</u>. The Practice Part includes reading these instructions, familiarising yourself with the task and answering one comprehension question. It is essential that you complete the Practice Part before you can proceed to the Task Part.  In such a case, you will receive a payment of £0.45. Once you have successfully answered all comprehension questions, you can move on to the Task Part. In this section, you can earn money by completing a series of short tasks. After the task part, a short questionnaire needs to be completed.</div>
<br>
<div>Please remember, to exit this economic experiment and receive your payment, you must click the "Leave" button and proceed to the next page. After doing so, a message will appear informing you that the experiment has concluded, and you may close your browser. If you exit the experiment without following this procedure, you will not receive any payment.</div>
<br>
<div>Please note that you cannot exit the experiment and receive payment until the Task Part and the Questionnaire have concluded. You will
    <b>not be paid</b> if you leave the experiment before the seven minutes allocated to work are over, or the questionnaire is not completed. If you decide to leave before conclusion of the experiment, you will not be able to start working again. To <b>be paid</b> according to the effort provided in the Task Part, it is necessary that you complete the experiment.</div>

<b>Task Part</b>
<br>
<br>
<div>In the Task Part, you will see a series of <b>words</b> (combinations of letters), each consisting of three capital letters. Your task is to encode each word by replacing each letter with a corresponding 3-digit number according to a provided code. You may <b>work at your own pace</b> within a <b>seven minute time frame</b>. Make sure to manage your time effectively to maximize your earnings.</div>
<br>
<div>How to encode: Each of 24 letters in the alphabet is linked to a specific 3-digit number. You will be presented with one word at a time. You will use a reference table above the word to find the correct number for each letter.</div>
<div>Please consider the following screenshot for an <b>example</b>.</div>
<img style=" max-width: 100%;height: auto;" src="{% static "Example.jpg" %}">
<div>In this example, the word is HMU. According to the reference table, H = 595, M = 288, and U = 901. In the screenshot, “595288901” has already been entered in the field below the word.</div>
<br>
<div>When the code for the word is complete, it needs to be confirmed by clicking on the <b>“OK” button, or</b> by pressing the <b>“Enter” key</b>. If the code is incorrect, the computer will prompt you to correct it. After wrong inputs, the current word to encode will not change until a correct input is made. </div>
<br>
<div>Once you successfully encode a word, the computer will provide a new word to encode. This process will continue for <b>seven minutes (420 seconds)</b>, with the table remaining the same throughout. At the top of the page, you see the remaining time. </div>
<br>
<b>Earning Money</b>
<br>
<br>
<div>You will earn a <b>payment per word</b> that you encoded correctly. In the top-right corner of the page, you see the number of words encoded so far. You receive £ [parameter1] for each encoded word. In addition, you will also receive a fixed amount of  £ [parameter2], irrespective of the number of words encoded.</div>
<br>
<div>Note that only you will benefit financially from your work; neither the experimenters nor anyone else will derive earnings from your efforts. The numbers that you input serve no purpose beyond this task.</div>
<br>
<br>
<b>Concluding the experiment</b>
<br><br>
<div>When the seven minutes are over, you will automatically see the questionnaire (which takes about 1 minute to complete). When the questionnaire is completed, you will automatically see a message informing you about your earnings. The message also includes the <u>Prolific link that you need to click to validate your participation</u>.</div>
<br>
<br>
<b>Practice Part</b>
<br><br>
<div>In the Practice Part, we ask you to code two words to familiarize yourself with the task and to answer one comprehension question. You have three attempts to enter each code and answer the comprehension question correctly. Using more than three attempts will end the experiment for you, and you will only receive a fixed payment of £ 0.45 Note that in the Practice Part, no additional earnings are awarded for correct answers.</div>
