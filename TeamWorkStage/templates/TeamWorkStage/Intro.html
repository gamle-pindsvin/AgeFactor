<div>Welcome to this economic experiment. The effort you provide here can result in a considerable monetary gain. It is crucial that you read these instructions attentively. It's important to note that, in contrast to some other social sciences, economic experiments adhere to a strict non-deception policy, ensuring that all information provided to you is accurate.</div>
<br>
<div>This economic experiment is divided into three parts: a <u>Practice Part</u>, where no money can be earned, a <u>Task Part</u>, where you can earn money, and a short <u>Questionnaire</u>. The Practice Part includes reading these instructions, familiarising yourself with the task and answering one comprehension question. It is essential that you complete the Practice Part before you can proceed to the Task Part.  In such a case, you will receive a payment of Â£0.45. Once you have successfully answered all comprehension questions, you can move on to the Task Part. In this section, you can earn money by completing a series of short tasks. After the task part, a short questionnaire needs to be completed.</div>
<br>
<div>Please remember, to exit this economic experiment and receive your payment, you must click the "Leave" button and proceed to the next page. After doing so, a message will appear informing you that the experiment has concluded, and you may close your browser. If you exit the experiment without following this procedure, you will not receive any payment.</div>
<br>
<div>Please note that you cannot exit the experiment and receive payment until the Task Part and the Questionnaire have concluded. You will
    <b>not be paid</b> if you leave the experiment before the seven minutes allocated to work are over, or the questionnaire is not completed.
